## 1. Introduction to AI Agents

**Summary:**
This section introduces the concept of AI agents, explaining their meaning and significance in the context of applications like ChatGPT. It emphasizes that AI agents act as intermediaries that can perform tasks based on requests by interacting with various tools and services.

**Key Concepts:**
- AI agents
- MCPs
- agent-to-agent protocol

**Explanation:**
AI agents are designed to take action based on user requests, differently from traditional large language models (LLMs) that can only provide text responses. They can interact with external systems to gather data, carry out actions, and make decisions.

--------------------
## 2. Limitations of LLMs

**Summary:**
This section discusses the inherent limitations of LLMs, highlighting that while they can generate text, pictures, or videos, they cannot perform actions by themselves.

**Key Concepts:**
- LLMs
- response generation
- limitations

**Explanation:**
LLMs like ChatGPT can generate responses but lack the capability to interact with external systems or perform tasks directly, underscoring the need for AI agents that bridge this gap.

--------------------
## 3. Functionality of AI Agents

**Summary:**
This section explains the operational processes of AI agents, illustrating how they can gather information, combine it with user preferences, and ultimately execute tasks like booking flights.

**Key Concepts:**
- third-party interactions
- memory
- decision-making

**Explanation:**
AI agents gather information from third-party platforms, remember past user interactions, and collaborate with LLMs to make informed decisions and take actions based on user requests.

--------------------
## 4. Examples of AI Agent Applications

**Summary:**
Here, the discussion moves to practical applications of AI agents, such as using code assistants like GitHub Copilot, which function as agents to assist programmers.

**Key Concepts:**
- GitHub Copilot
- code assistants
- agent mode

**Explanation:**
Popular tools like GitHub Copilot showcase how AI agents operate in real-world applications by assisting users in generating code and providing relevant suggestions.
