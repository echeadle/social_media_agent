## 1. Importance of Sleep for Hormonal Balance

**Summary:**
The connection between sleep and hormone restoration is crucial, especially testosterone, which acts as the body's repair crew during the night. Quality sleep is essential for maintaining hormonal balance, which impacts many bodily functions, including sexual health.

**Key Concepts:**
- testosterone
- deep sleep
